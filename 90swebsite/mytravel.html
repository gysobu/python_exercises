    <p>The site of the Empire State Building, located on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, 
        was originally part of an early 18th century farm. In the late 1820s, it came into the possession of the prominent Astor family, with John Jacob Astor's descendants building the Waldorfâ€“Astoria Hotel on the site in the 1890s. By the 1920s, 
        the family had sold the outdated hotel and the site indirectly ended up under the ownership of Empire State Inc.</p>
